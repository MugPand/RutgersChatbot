01:198:105,Great Insights in Computer Science,The class is a tour of the big ideas that make computer science an academic discipline. We tour the architecture of modern computers from bits and logic all the way up to programming languages and software libraries. We probe the insights in computability and algorithm design that make possible massive search engines like Google and help us understand the relation between computation and intelligence. Coursework primarily involves paper-and-pencil problem solving and a very small amount of programming to provide students with hands-on-experience with the concepts we introduce.,3,01:640:026 or 01:640:027,"QR, ITR",https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-105-great-insights-in-computer-science,"introduction, elementary,"
01:198:107,Computing for Math and the Sciences,"This course is designed to introduce the student to computers, programming, and some of the key ideas on which the field of computer science is based. The primary vehicle for doing so is the computer language MATLAB. The use of a program like MAPLE to manipulate symbolic equations is also covered. This course is aimed at students majoring in math or in a physical science.",4,CALC 1,"QR, ITR",https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-107-computing-for-math-and-the-sciences,"MATLAB, MAPLE, math, physical science"
01:198:110,Principles of Computer Science,"Computer Science concepts are relevant to many aspects of our lives, from explorations in the fields of science and medicine to digital creations in the fields of art and music. This course introduces students to the central ideas of computer science and explores technologies of computing and their impact on society and culture.  Students are introduced to web site design, data investigation and manipulation using spreadsheets, collaborative on-line tools, and fundamental computer programming concepts.  Students develop computational skills and are engaged in the creative aspects of problem solving through programming. Students investigate the global impacts and social implications of computing innovations, data, and the Internet through discussions, projects, and writing.",3,N/A,"QR, ITR",https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-110-introduction-to-computers-and-their-application,"webdesign, programming, basic analysis, spreadsheets"

01:198:142,Data 101: Data Literacy,"This class aims to provide you with a basic set of tools for data literacy as well as general view of the impact of data on society and elements of common sense data analysis and reasoning.   A significant piece of the class will be learning foundations of  R. R is a statistical software environment and programming language that we’ll use to analyze and visualize datasets.  Learning simple R will take some work; however, if you’re able to master the basics covered in this class, you’ll gain a concrete, marketable skill that may very well be extremely useful in your academic and professional life. On the statistical side, we’ll cover basic topics from statistics and probability that are required to argue persuasively using data (a list of some of the topics to be covered can be found below).   This is not a “typical” Statistics 101 class; instead of covering an exhaustive list of topics and asking you to memorize many formulas, our goal is to focus only on the most important topics for convincingly analyzing data now by solving “hands on” weekly data puzzles. This class is taught in unique manner – students have to solve “data puzzles” (one or more weekly) and  defend their solutions in class in the so called “Court of Data”.     Students compete in the semester long competition for the titles of Data Masters (aggregated score for all data puzzles and the project). One of the objectives of the class is to show the danger of false, random conclusions from data and learning right methodology of “healthy skepticism”. We will also discuss how not to be fooled by data and show examples of rushed and ad hoc conclusions from so called “big data” in the news and on the web.  In addition we will examine both upside and downside of big data on the web.  We will talk about privacy, anonymity  vs personalization and data ownership when we increasingly rely on online services. In Final project   your data findings should have real consequences, preferably “actionable” and consequential in the real society.",4,01:640:026,"N21C, QQ, QR, ITR",https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-142-data-101-data-literacy,"data, data science, statistics, R, puzzles, "
